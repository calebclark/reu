I've tried to keep the structure of this pretty flat. The folders here are:
GSseq - A simple sequential implementation of GS in C.
GScuda - A simple CUDA implementation of GS. (Not finished)
others - Code I have received from other people, used mainly as a reference/consulted for ideas.
writings - Things I've written for the reu.
